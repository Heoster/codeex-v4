/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CODEEX AI application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles. Each user can only
 * access and modify their own profile data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * User profiles are stored in the `/users/{userId}` collection, where `{userId}` matches the
 * user's Firebase Authentication UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Write operations MUST be authenticated.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in prototyping mode, focusing on ownership checks rather than
 *   strict schema enforcement.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `id` field within the User document is used to enforce path consistency and prevent
 * unauthorized data access. The `id` field is immutable to prevent privilege escalation.
